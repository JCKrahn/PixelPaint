        <h2>Create a new Image</h2>
        <p>
          Go to File/New. Customize your new Image by setting its width/
          height and background (you can get additional info by clicking the
          '?' - then click on something that you want to know more about).
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="block">
        <h2>Open an Image</h2>
        <p>
          Go to File/Open - PixelPaint supports JPG (with 3 channels)
          and PNG (with 4 channels).
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="block">
        <h2>Save your Image</h2>
        <p>
          Go to File/Save or Save as. If you want your Image to have
          transparency - save it as a PNG.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="block">
        <h2>Paint-Window</h2>

          <b>Controls:</b><br>
          <em>Left-click</em> the Image to work with the tool you selected,
          if no tool is selected you can drag the Image around.<br>

          <em>Right-click</em> the Image to drag it around (also works if you
          have a tool selected).<br>

          <em>Hover over the Image and press Ctrl + mouse-wheel-up/
            mouse-wheel-down</em> to zoom in/ out.<br>

          <em>Press Z/ Y</em> to undo/ redo changes.<br>

          <em>Press S</em> to quick-save the Image.

        <h2>Color-Palette</h2>
        <p>
          Select the color that you want to work with by left-clicking it.<br>
          Right-click a color to change it.<br>

        <h2>Fill-Tool</h2>
        <p>
          The Fill-Tool lets you fill an area with your selected color.<br>
          To cancel the Fill-Operation click the close button of the
          Paint-Window (the window won't close in this specific case; if you
          want to close the window click the close button again).<br>
          <b>Settings</b> (Settings/PaintWindow Settings)<b>:</b><br>
          You can enable/ adjust the Fill-Tolerance which determines how much
          the pixel colors can differ to be still filled.<br>
          You can disable the Fill-Algorithm Visualization to gain
          performance.<br>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="block">
        <h2>Image-Maxsize</h2>
        <p>
          The Image Maxsize prevents you from experiencing performance issues
          and crashes (PixelPaint is simply not designed to handle big images).
          You can disable it (Settings/PaintWindow Settings) but be warned.
