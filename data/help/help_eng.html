        <h2>Create a new Image</h2>
        <p>
          Go to File/New. Customize your new Image by setting its width/
          height and background (you can get additional info by clicking the
          '?' - then click on something that you want to know more about).
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="block">
        <h2>Open an Image</h2>
        <p>
          Go to File/Open; PixelPaint supports JPG and PNG.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="block">
        <h2>Save your Image</h2>
        <p>
          Go to File/Save and choose how your Image should be saved.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="block">
        <h2>Paint-Window</h2>
        <p>(Pops up if you have created/ opened an Image)</p>
        <b>Controls:</b><br>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Left-click</em> the Image to work with the tool you selected,
          if no tool is selected you can drag the Image around.</li>

          <li><em>Right-click</em> the Image to drag it around (also works if you
          have a tool selected).<br></li>

          <li><em>Hover over the Image and press Ctrl + mouse-wheel-up/
            mouse-wheel-down</em> to zoom in/ out.</li>

          <li><em>Press Z/ Y</em> to undo/ redo changes.</li>

          <li><em>Press S</em> to quick-save the Image.</li>

      <div class="block">
        <h2>Tool-Bar</h2>
        <p>
          Select the tool that you want to work with by left-clicking it.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="block">
        <h2>Color-Palette</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Select the color that you want to work with by left-clicking it.</li>
          <li>Right-click a color to change it.</li>

      <div class="block">
        <h2>Fill-Tool</h2>
        <p>
          The Fill-Tool lets you fill an area with your selected color.<br>
          To cancel the Fill-Operation click the close button of the
          Paint-Window (the window won't close in this specific case; if you
          want to close the window click the close button again).<br>
          <b>Settings</b> (Settings/PaintWindow Settings)<b>:</b><br>
          <ul>
            <li>You can switch between two modes:
              <ul>
                <li>fill in all pixels with matching color</li>
                <li>fill in only connected pixels with matching color (the first
                mode is faster!)</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>You can enable/ adjust the Fill-Tolerance which determines how much
            the pixel colors can differ/ have to match to be filled.</li>
            <li>You can enable the Fill-Algorithm Visualization to see how the
            algorithm works (this will decrease the performance a lot!).</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="block">
        <h2>Image-Maxsize</h2>
        <p>
          The Image Maxsize prevents you from experiencing performance issues
          and crashes (PixelPaint is simply not designed to handle big images).
          You can disable it (Settings/PaintWindow Settings) but be warned.
